# Showcasting FISH-quant and ImJoy

Here, we provide **several interactive tutorials** to show how to analyze and interpret your smFISH data in ImJoy. 

!> We provide **test data**, to allow you to directly use the different workflow. This documentation is, however, only intended 
to provide an introduction for how these ImJoy plugins work. If you **like these tools**, 
we invite you to install and use the plugins as explained in the different sections.
